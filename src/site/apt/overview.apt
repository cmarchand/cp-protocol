CP Protocol

  cp-protocol is a protocol implementation that is used to extend URL mecanisms
  and to allow to specify resources located in classpath.

  Resources URL form is :

+----
cp:<path-to-resource>
+----

  where <path-to-resource> is a path that is compliant to {{{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getResourceAsStream-java.lang.String-}Class.getResourceAsStream(String)}}

  A helper class is provided to register this protocol : {{{./apidocs/top/marchand/xml/protocols/ProtocolInstaller.html}ProtocolInstaller}}\
  Just call :

+----
top.marchand.xml.protocols.ProtocolInstaller.registerAdditionalProtocols()
+----

 before creating any <<<java.net.URL>>>, so in the <<<main(String[])>>> of your application, for example.

* Starting your application with <<<cp:>>> protocol support without modifying it 

 You can also start your application via <<<ProtocolInstaller.main(...)>>>. If your application is started via

+----
java your.package.YourClass arg1 arg2 arg3
+----

 just start it  via

+----
java top.marchand.xml.protocols.ProtocolInstaller your.package.YourClass arg1 arg2 arg3
+----
 and you will be able to use <<<cp:...>>> URL forms...
